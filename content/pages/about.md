Hi! I am a Computer Science Graduate currently working out of Bangalore. I like tinkering around with electronics projects and contributing to open source codebases (I plan to write about these dabblings in this blog). I also like reading, listening to synthwave/rock music and, playing Call of Duty/Apex Legends sometimes.
